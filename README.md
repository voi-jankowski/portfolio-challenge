# Voi Jankowski Portfolio

## Project Description

The Portfolio has been created to showcase my work to potential employers, so they can have access to my work samples and contact details to reach out to me through different channels.

## Links

Have a look at my [live page](https://voi-jankowski.github.io/portfolio-challenge/) or visit the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/voi-jankowski/portfolio-challenge)

## Usage

When you open the page you can find the navigation links inside the colourful bubbles next to my photo (right under the header if you are on a mobile or a tablet, or on the right if you are using a desktop). Click on any of them to be taken to the relevant part of the page. There is also a Resume link that takes you to the PDF file of my CV.
